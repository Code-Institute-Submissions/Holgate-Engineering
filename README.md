<p>I have used this project to create a website for our family business. My grandfather, father & uncle have all worked in the family engineering business for over 50 years however they have never had a webpage dedicated to the work they do. This website will advertise their services and offer examples of their work to potential clients.</p>

<h3 id="uk">UX</h3>
The aim of this project is to primarily raise awareness that the business exists and is in operation. Having had no online presence previously, this webiste's main purpose is to reach the customers that are requiring these services. The secondary purpose will be to generate more enquiries and ultimately business for the company. 

<h4 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h4>
Please see the wireframes for this project:<br>

<h4 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h4>
The target audience for this website can be split into two categories. Firstly it is aimed at potential local customers. These are both business and personal customers who could benefit from the services offered by Holgate Engineering. The second target would be national companies that are looking for a smaller engineering company to perform bespoke or production work to a high standard. 

 It will also provide a detailed explanation of the types of work that can be carried out. For example, Holgate Engineering regularly repairs the local bakeries mechanical equipment insitu. Similar businesses may be looking for an equivilant service but are unaware of Holgate Engineering's wide range of services on offer.
<br>Targeting larger companies nationwide will be a secondary objective for the website. Holgate Engineering already has a number of national companies that they provide production parts for. However these were acquired by word of mouth and so the website will be used to showcase to similar customers that they are already successfully completing high volume production work.

For both categories of audience, the demographic to be targeted will be predominently customers over the age of 25. The reason for this being, a very large proportion of Holgate Engineering's current clients fall into this demographic. Also the style of machinery used in this workshop is more suited to more "Old Fashioned Engineering". This is not to discourage the younger generation but Holgate Engineering needs to website to be suitable for their key customers. 

<h4 id="website-aim">Website Aim</h4>
This website will be used to provide the knowledge to local customers on what the business can offer them and why Holgate Engineering should be chosen. For example, the business owners would like to show that they can offer the same services as an original manufacturer. For example, a car part needing refurbishment can be completed quicker and cheaper by Holgate Engineering than if the part was to be sent back to the original manufacturer.
It will also aim to supply customers with confidence in the company. This is especially important for a business that has previously had no online presence. 
In essence, the website will be a window into workshop and needs to be used to gain customer's confidence and lead to an enquiry or job.

<h4 id="user-stories">User Stories</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a personal customer I would like to explore the services offered, to do this I can easily click on the "Services" page and scroll through the options available.</li>
<li>As a personal customer I would like to check the reputation of the business and their safety procedures. I can easily access the Covid safety procedures via the link in the footer and can see the testimonials from other customers as soon as I access the webpage.</li>
<li>As a business customer I would like to ensure the service I require is available and get a quick and easy quote. I can do this simply by accessing the "Services" page and once I have found the service required, I can use the Contact Form to send a request.</li>
<li>As a user of the website I would like to be able to use the website on any type of device and be able to navigate through the website easily on any device. I have tried the website on a tablet, mobile and a desktop and the layout remains the same so I can easily access the pages required.</li>
<li>As a user I want to be able to locate contact details easily from any page on the website. I am able to find the contact number and email address easily via the website footer which is available on every page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
This project has been tailored towards the target audience, with the aims in mind. Testimonials have been used to instil confidence in the user. Placed on the homepage, these will be one of the first things that are absorbed by the user. By using a personal & a business customer testimonial, it will be relatable to both of the target audiences.
The services page, although laid out in a simple design, provides all of the neccessary information a potential client would need to make an informed decision. Also, the grid structure provides easy access to the information. 
Based on the existing customer demographic and the fact that Holgate Engineering provides a service that is not very often seen any more, the website needs to be easy to navigate. Many visitors to the website may not be particularly tech savy so the layout is easy to read and the menu headings are always shown. This will avoid any confusion for users as to how to navigate to the information they require. The design, however, also needs to appeal to the business customers. The strong lines and square shapes will appeal to these customers as it is in keeping with the products and services being advertised. Engineering is seen as a strong and precise profession therefore the website design mirrors this. 

A business customer's main aim when visiting the site will be to check that Holgate Enginering offers the service required and then to get in touch for a quote. The layout means this is simple for them to do. A visit to the 'Services' page will allow them to pinpoint the service required and then they can easily call Holgate Engineering from the number supplied in the footer or by visiting the 'Contact Page' and submitting a quote request. 

A personal customer's aim would also be to check the service they are requiring is on offer however their decision making may be influenced by a trust in the company. If they are requiring a repair on their car, for example, the quality of the repair will be paramount to their safety. Therefore they may also be interested in other people's opinions before buying. They are also more likely to visit the premises than a business customer so they will need to be made aware of the location and the COVID-19 safety measures in place. For this reason, the location and COVID-19 risk assessment are placed next to each other to allow customers to browse these before calling.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


<h4 id="features">Features</h4>


<h4 id="existing-features">Existing Features</h4>
<ol>
<li>Navbar - Allows users to navigate through the website by clear headings on the navbar. Clicking on each will direct them to the page they require.</li>
<li>Main Image - Allows customers to see an example of Holgate Engineering's work and also provides movement on the page. This draws the customers attention to the image and also the companies moto which is layered over the image.</li>
<li>Footer - Allows users to quickly locate important information such as contact details and risk assessments no matter which page they are viewing.</li>
<li>Services Modals - Allows customers to gain an idea of prices for each service on offer without having to contact the company. By clicking on the 'Prices' button, a modal in shown on the same page to avoid customers have to navigate back to the section they were currently viewing.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>

<h5>Validators</h5>
<ul>
<li>W3C HTML Validator</li>
<li>W3C CSS Validator</li></ul>

<h5>Manual Testing</h5>
I manually tested the following to make sure they worked as designed:

<h5>Navbar</h5>
<ul>
<li>Viewing the Navbar from each of the three pages, it looks identical.</li>
<li>There are three options: Home, Services, Contact.</li>
<li>Clicking on the Home link will takes you to the index.html page.</li>
<li>Clicking on the Services link takes you to the services.html page.</li>
<li>Clicking on the Contact link takes you to the contact.html page.</li>
</ul>

<h5>COVID-19 Risk Assessment</h5>
<ul>
<li>Scroll to the footer and the link is labelled.</li>
<li>Upon clicking on the link, the COVID-19 risk assessment will open as a PDF in a separate browser window.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Contact Form</h5>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "Contact" link.</li>
<li>Submitting the form without a name is not permitted. A warning appears "Please fill in this field".</li>
<li>After entering a name and trying to submit, a warning "Please fill in this field" appears below the phone number box.</li>
<li>After entering a phone number and trying to submit, a warning "Please fill in this field" appears below the emaill address box.</li>
<li>After entering an emaill address and trying to submit, a warning "Please fill in this field" appears below the requirements box.</li>
<li>Therefore the form cannot be submitted without all of te required items.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Services Modals</h5>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "Services" link.</li>
<li>Click on the "Prices" button below each service item.</li>
<li>A modal will appear centrally on the screen.</li>
<li>Clicking on the "Close" button will remove the modal.</li>
<li>Clicking on the "X" will also remove the modal.</li>
</ul>

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h4>Deployment</h4>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
