I have used this project to create a website for our family business. My grandfather, father & uncle have all worked in the family engineering business for over 50 years however they have never had a webpage dedicated to the work they do. This website will advertise their services and offer examples of their work to potential clients. 


Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

<h4>UX</h4>
The aim of this project is to primarily raise awareness that the business exists and is in operation. Having had no online presence previously, this webiste's main purpose is to reach the customers that are requiring these services. The secondary purpose will be to generate more enquiries and ultimately business for the company. 

<h4>Target Audience</h4>
The target audience for this website can be split into two categories. Firstly it is aimed at potential local customers. These are both business and personal customers who could benefit from the services offered by Holgate Engineering. The second target would be national companies that are looking for a smaller engineering company to perform bespoke or production work to a high standard. 

 It will also provide a detailed explanation of the types of work that can be carried out. For example, Holgate Engineering regularly repairs the local bakeries mechanical equipment insitu. Similar businesses may be looking for an equivilant service but are unaware of Holgate Engineering's wide range of services on offer.
<br>Targeting larger companies nationwide will be a secondary objective for the website. Holgate Engineering already has a number of national companies that they provide production parts for. However these were acquired by word of mouth and so the website will be used to showcase to similar customers that they are already successfully completing high volume production work.

For both categories of audience, the demographic to be targeted will be predominently customers over the age of 25. The reason for this being, a very large proportion of Holgate Engineering's current clients fall into this demographic. Also the style of machinery used in this workshop is more suited to more "Old Fashioned Engineering". This is not to discourage the younger generation but Holgate Engineering needs to website to be suitable for their key customers. 

<h4>Website Aim</h4>
This website will be used to provide the knowledge to local customers on what the business can offer them and why Holgate Engineering should be chosen. For example, the business owners would like to show that they can offer the same services as an original manufacturer. For example, a car part needing refurbishment can be completed quicker and cheaper by Holgate Engineering than if the part was to be sent back to the original manufacturer.
It will also aim to supply customers with confidence in the company. This is especially important for a business that has previously had no online presence. 
In essence, the website will be a window into workshop and needs to be used to gain customer's confidence and lead to an enquiry or job.

<h4>Achieving this goal</h4>
This project has been tailored towards the target audience, with the aims in mind. Testimonials have been used to instil confidence in the user. Placed on the homepage, these will be one of the first things that are absorbed by the user. By using a personal & a business customer testimonial, it will be relatable to both of the target audiences.
The services page, although laid out in a simple design, provides all of the neccessary information a potential client would need to make an informed decision. Also, the grid structure provides easy access to the information. 


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
